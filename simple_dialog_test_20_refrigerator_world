#Some first cut entries for the refrigerator universe.
#I am not sure if this is the right format.  I just wanted to get something
#in place.
#The only elements in the refrigerator (so far) are egg, milk and bacon.
#There are two kinds of milk: regular and non-fat.
#There are two kinds of eggs, raw and hard-boiled.
#If something can’t be found in the refrigerator, it is behind the milk.
