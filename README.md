## Status
This software is in pre-release and intended for educational purposes only.

## Environment
This repository contains a slightly modified copy of chatterbot v1.0.4. The version of chatterbot included herein must be used to ensure proper functionality.

## Guidance on how to interact with FridgeBot
1) Download all 3 files (FridgeBot.py, FridgeLogic.py, and refrigerator_world_training.py)
2) FridgeBot.py is the main file; run this file. It will call upon the other 2 files for training and logic adapters
3) FridgeBot is a smart assistant for your fridge
4) Engage in smalltalk with FridgeBot like "hello" and "how are you?"
5) The contents of the fridge can be eggs, bacon, and milk.
6) You can interact with FridgeBot by asking what is in the fridge, where in the fridge certain items are located, and schedule an order for more food.
7) Because FridgeBot is trained on a narrow set of phrases, we recommend using the following:<br/>
  a) "What is in the fridge?"<br/>
  b) "Do we have any bacon left?"<br/>
  c) "Where is the milk?"<br/>
  d) "Where is the chocolate milk?"<br/>
  e) "Are you sure?"<br/>
  f) "Do we have any eggs?"<br/>
  g) "Do we have any deviled eggs?"<br/>
  h) "Why don't we have deviled eggs?"<br/>
  i) "I am too lazy to cook right now"<br/>
  j) "I would like to place an order"<br/>
  k) "bacon"<br/>
  l) "5"<br/>
  m) "evening"<br/>
  n) "I would like to schedule an order"<br/>
  o) "milk"<br/>
  p) "2 gallons"<br/>
  q) "morning"<br/>
  r) "What is the status of my order?"<br/>
  s) "reschdule my order"<br/>
  t) "afternoon"<br/>
  u) "my order has arrived"<br/>
  v) "what's in the fridge?"<br/>
  w) "thank you"<br/>
  x) "exit"<br/>
8) NOTE: FridgeBot seems to behave best when there is no training beyond that provided programmatically within the code. If exitting FridgeBot and starting over, delete any sql files that FridgeBot creates in its directory prior to running FridgeBot again.
